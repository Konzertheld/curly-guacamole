Functions needed:
- Get free space on day
- Find next day with X free space
- Find next day with X percent free space
- Figure out how much space can be freed by moving a task#4

How to fill days
- X hours per day for tasks, prohibit adding more
- do not auto-fill up to X
- subtract 20/30min or so for each task

- A day has 24 hours. 10 for sleep. 2 for cooking. 2 more for other meals, pooping etc. = 10h
- take lectures and appointments into account - done by google calendar import

Auto-read sent mails

Hacks:
- Grab old Google "event" tasks that have not been managed via the Planer: Manually change Google last update date, reload, events will be spread over the next days, mark as done, *rewind date again* and update, those events will get updated with the Google date again, overwriting the newly assigned dates, and they will not get assigned a new date again as they are now done. This overwriting behaviour will most likely become annoying somewhen
